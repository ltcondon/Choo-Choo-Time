# Summary

## Technology

The app was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, moment.JS, and uses Google's Firebase as a way to store and retrieve user data.

## Current State

At the time of writing, the train schedule works as explained above, but does not yet posess the functionality to show updated train times.
